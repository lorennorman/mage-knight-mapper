mage-knight-mapper
==================

HTML5 app that simulates the terrain generation system for (Mage Knight: Board Game)[http://wizkidsgames.com/mageknight/].

Suitable for table top display and direct use in a game session. We want to augment the board game, leveraging virtually infinite computing power to explode the possibilities and allow the choice of interesting constraints.

Play with it (here)[http://lorennorman.github.com/mage-knight-mapper].
